## 👨🏻‍💻 Doing
- My life has taken some twists and turns, and along one of those turns, I made a right (decision) in exploring this little idea of making the world a better place through data.  So, for now I'm looking for a job as a Data Scientist, and working on personal projects.  The project I'm curently working on involves experimenting with the Spotify API to gain some experience developing a recomneder system.  Some of the tools/libraries used were SKLearn/XGBoost/RandomForestClassifiers/ROCAUC.

## 📚 Learning and Hobby
- Currently refining/augmenting AWS skills, and other cloud computing services.  I've also taken an interest in house plants. I know, kind of out of left field, and not keeping with the theme.  If you're interested, try getting yourself a *Ficus elastica*; the variegated type is particularly appealing.  It is a relatively easy plant to care for, and gorgeous.

## 🤝 Collaborative Work
- I've been looking at random python based repos, and attempted to improve them by applying PEP8 starndards for two reasons.  The first, I want PEP8 and general readable code to be second nature for me; and second, everyone wins!  But as far as other colaborations, I'm working on the recomender system project with a fullstack webdeveloper friend.

## 🙏 Want to help me with...
- Well, everything.  Please take a look at any of my projects, and provide feedback on anything you see can use some improvement.

## 💭 Something Interesting
- Ask me about the time I worked on an olive farm in Catalonia, Spain; and how that pushed me to change in career paths (not from farmer to data scientist).
