# The Life of a Novice Data Scientist

- 👨🏻‍💻 What am I currently doing?  Well, my life has taken some twists and turns, and along one of those turns, I made a right (decision) in exploring this little idea of making the world a better place through data.  So, for now I'm looking for a job as a Data Scientist, and working on polishing my side projects.  The project I'm currently beautifying is one where I took a public traffic collisions dataset, and built a predictive model.  This particular peice allowed me flex some of that ML muscle.  Some of the tools/libraries used were SKLearn/XGBoost/RandomForestClassifiers/ROCAUC and PDPs.  Check back shortly for an update.
- 📚 Currently refining/learning AWS, and other cloud computing services.  And I've also taken an interest in house plants. I know, kind of out of left field, and not keeping with the theme.  But yeah, I've taken advantage of the pandemic and developed the hobby.  If you're interested try getting yourself a *Ficus elastica*; the variegated type is particularly appealing, but a bit more difficult to maintain.  It is a relatively easy plant to care for, and absolutely gorgeous.
- 🤝 I've been looking at random python based repos, and attempted to improve them by applying PEP8 starndards for two reasons.  The first, I want PEP8 and general readable code to be second nature for me; and second, everyone wins!  But as far as other colaborations, I'd be interested in getting together with an app development team/person to help me create some ideas I have in mind regarding pant identification.
- 🙏 What I'm currently looking for help with?  Well, everything.  Please take a look at any of my projects, and provide feedback on anything you see can use some improvement.  But more specifically, I've been having trouble setting up plotly on jupyter lab, and have it generate visualizations.  I am able to do it in jupyter notebook, but for some reason jupyter lab is being stubborn.  I've tried a few different things, and have yet to hear from StackOverflow, but my fingers are crossed, and I'm hopeful.  We'll see what happens, the community always comes through.
- 💭 Ask me about the time I worked on an olive farm in Catalonia, Spain; and how that pushed me over the edge and precipitated a change in career paths (not from farmer to data scientist).
