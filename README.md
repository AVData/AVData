## 👨🏻‍💻 Doing
- My life has taken some twists and turns, and along one of those turns, I made a right (decision) in exploring this little idea of making the world a better place through data. I'm currently making my way through my career as a Data Engineer, and working on personal projects that excite me and bring me meaning. The project I'm curently working on involves experimenting with AI agents (which seem to be all the rave right now) and utilzign them to optmimize workflows of different kinds. Some of the tools/libraries I'm using are Python, SQL, Gobii, jupyter Notebooks, and handful of others.

## 📚 Learning and Hobby
- Currently augmenting engineering skills by refining SQL and Database knowledge. I'm also an avid reader and writer. I tend to spend my downtime answering question prompts to and exploring my own mind, and psyche to better understand human nature from a singular perspective.

## 🤝 Collaborative Work
- I've been looking at random python based repos, and attempted to improve them by applying PEP8 starndards for two reasons. The first, I want PEP8 and general readable code to be second nature for me; and second, everyone wins.

## 💭 Something Interesting
- Ask me about the time I worked on an olive farm in Catalonia, Spain; and how that pushed me to change career path (from farmer to data engineer).
